# Meta-Mushroom: Automatic Fungi Classification

In this project two different methods of incorporating metadata into image classification with a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) are explored and compared against a baseline using only image data. Three different binary classifiers for determining mushroom edibility are developed on a sample of about 4,000 images of fungi from the Danish Fungi 2020 Mini (DF20M) dataset [8]. First, a pre-trained Vision Transformer with a dense MLP head is fine-tuned for image classification as the baseline. Then fungi metadata (month, substrate, habitat) is incorporated into the model by concatenation before the final output layer for the second classifier. Another strategy of incorporating metadata, in which the metadata feature space is first mapped out by a decision tree and classifiers are selected based on the leaf nodes, is finally explored and discussed. Neither of the two models incorporating metadata manage to outperform the baseline. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96435235/207957922-cf3fb949-b294-491a-967d-05427ffef75d.png)
